Speak your truth quietly and clearly;and listen to others, even the dull and the ignorant;they too have their story. Avoid loud and aggressive persons,they are vexations to the spirit"

    title: Nineteen Eighty-Four
    author: George Orwell
    body: "The Ministry of Truth - Minitrue, in Newspeak - was startlingly different from any other object in sight.

    title: Declaration of Independence
    author: Founding Fathers
    body: "When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed"

    title: 1 Corinthians 13
    author: Paul the Apostle
    body: "Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not love, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not love, I am nothing. And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not love, it profiteth me nothing."
